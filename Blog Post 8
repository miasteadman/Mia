	This is my school. 
	It is called the University of New Haven. 
	It is located in West Haven, CT. Here is a photo of one of our quads. The building in the photo is called Maxcy Hall.

<p> This is a rollercoaster. Rollercoasters are pretty fun. Some people hate rollercoasters, and that is cool too. This photo was taken around sunset, so the sky looks pretty. </p>
